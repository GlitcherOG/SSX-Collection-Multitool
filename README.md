# SSX Collection Multitool
 
This is a redone version of my [original tool](https://github.com/GlitcherOG/SSX-PS2-Collection-Modder) created in .net framework. It was moved over to .net due to certain limitations discovered in the programs development that made loading of certain files next to impossible as such it was decided to just redo the entire project and improve it as i did.

## Current Todo
- Redo Folder Loading SSH
- SSH Colour Fix
- LOC Script Update
- Export As Txt
- Import As Txt if line count matches
- Convert All Vector3/4 to float arrays
- export hash data
- export Camera Data

## Todo
- Setup ISO Handler
- Setup Settings Page
- SSX 3, OG, Tricky Pages
- Delete PAD files
- Allow Arguments to boot certain forms at launch
- Character DB
- Music INF Editor
- Custom Forms For SSX, Tricky, SSX 3
- Open File location On Big Extraction and Making/SSH Files
- PBD Json Files
 - Camera Json
 - Mesh Data Output
