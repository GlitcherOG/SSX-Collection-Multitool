# SSX Collection Multitool
 
This is a redone version of my [original tool](https://github.com/GlitcherOG/SSX-PS2-Collection-Modder) created in .net framework. It was moved over to .net due to certain limitations discovered in the programs development that made loading of certain files next to impossible as such it was decided to just redo the entire project and improve it as i did.

## Current Features
- SSH (SHPS) Texture Extractor/Maker (SSX, Tricky, SSX 3)
- Big Decompressor and Compressor (BigF, Big4 And C0FB)
- Character DB Editor (SSX 3)
- Music Inf Editor (SSX 3)
- Loc (Language) Files Editor
- (WIP) SSX 3 Store/Item Editing (BoltPS2.Dat)
- SSX MPF Model Extractor/Importer (Tricky, 3, On Tour)

## Current Todo
- Fix Big Compression Lagging
- Fix Model Header Amination PDB
- SSX Tricky Mass Texture Replacer
- SSX 3 Normal Average Proper
- SSX Tricky Normal Average Proper
- Redo Folder Loading SSH
- LOC Script Update

## Todo
