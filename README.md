# SSX Collection Multitool

This is a completely remade version of my [original tool](https://github.com/GlitcherOG/SSX-PS2-Collection-Modder) created with the .NET framework. It was moved over to .NET due to certain limitations discovered in the program's development that made the loading of certain files next to impossible.  
As such, I chose to redo the entire project and improve it as I did so.

## Current Features
### General
- SSH (SHPS) Texture Extractor/Maker (SSX, Tricky, SSX 3)
- Big Decompressor and Compressor (BigF, Big4 And C0FB)
